<h2>Process</h2>

This app was inspired by The Odin Project application challenge to create a simple library. I'm modified it a bit to be even simpler and easier to use/understand. 

This project took me about a day and a half to code and style. It's my first attempt at using classes and is very object oriented. The trickiest part of the process was creating a 'remove' button in each card. 

I may come back to this and update it later, but I believe this is an excellent starting place and a basis for many other apps!
